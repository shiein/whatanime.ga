## Integrating search with whatanime.ga
To add whatanime.ga as a search option for your site, pass the image URL via query string like this
```
https://whatanime.ga/?url=http://searchimageurl
```

You can also specify playback options like this
```
https://whatanime.ga/?autoplay=0&loop&mute=1&url=http://searchimageurl
```

Playback URL params:

| param    | value  | default (not set in URL param) | set with empty or other value |
|----------|--------|---|---|
| autoplay | 0 or 1 | 1 | 1 |
| mute     | 0 or 1 | 0 | 1 |
| loop     | 0 or 1 | 0 | 1 |

The `auto` URL parameter is no longer used, it would always search automatically when there is `?url=` param.

Note that the server cannot access private image URLs.
In that case, users has to copy and paste (Ctrl+V/Cmd+V) the image directly, or save and upload the file.
